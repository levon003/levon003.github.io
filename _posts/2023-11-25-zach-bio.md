I submitted the following bio for my NeurIPS 2023 profile. Putting it here in case it's useful again in the future:

Zachary Levonian is a human-computer interaction researcher working in industry as a machine learning researcher/engineer. He is currently doing applied education research at the Learning Engineering Virtual Institute (LEVI) and Digital Harbor Foundation.

Zach is a **builder**: he loves shipping prototypes and production code that implement cutting-edge ML methods.
