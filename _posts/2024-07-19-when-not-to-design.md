["When the implication is not to design (technology)"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1978942.1979275) ([pdf](https://ics.uci.edu/~djp3/classes/2011_01_INF134/papers/impl9-rev.pdf)) is a classic [CHI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_on_Human_Factors_in_Computing_Systems) paper on when not to design that is continually relevant in human-computer interaction.

The paper asks three questions "that can help researchers, designers, and practitioners articulate a technology’s appropriateness or inappropriateness":
 - Could the technology be replaced by an equally viable low-tech or non-technological approach to the situation?
 - Does a technological intervention result in more trouble or harm than the situation it’s meant to address?
 - Does a technology solve a computationally tractable transformation of a problem rather than the problem itself?

These questions are highly relevant to a lot of [contemporary "AI" work]({% post_url 2024-06-26-destroy-ai %}).
