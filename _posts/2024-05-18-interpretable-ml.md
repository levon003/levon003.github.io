On the subject of interpretable machine learning, I always recommend Cynthia Rudin's work first.

Start with her excellent talk ["Scoring Systems: At the Extreme of Interpretable Machine Learning"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vyPW3BL2c8&t=160s) (2022) and some of the papers and packages it references.

Her 2021 paper on grand challenges in interpretable machine learning is still worth reading: ["Interpretable Machine Learning: Fundamental Principles and 10 Grand Challenges"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11251).
