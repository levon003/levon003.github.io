THe classic recommendation for learning about [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) is Sutton and Barto's ["Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction"](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html)

On Bluesky recently, a few people [recommended reinforcement learning resources](https://bsky.app/profile/juand-r.bsky.social/post/3lgz67v5b322t). Here are a few of the suggestions:

 - "Reinforcement Learning: Foundations" by Shie Mannor, Yishay Mansour, and Aviv Tamar: <https://sites.google.com/view/rlfoundations/home>
 - "A Little Bit of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback" by Nathan Lambert: <https://rlhfbook.com/>
 - "PPO in 180 lines of NumPy" by Apoorv Nandan: <https://apoorvx.com/posts/ppo/>
