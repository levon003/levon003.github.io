On structuring and processing data:
 - "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann: <https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/>
 - "Big Data: Principles and best practices of scalable realtime data systems" by Nathan Marz and James Warren: <https://www.manning.com/books/big-data>

On relational database indexing:
 - "Use the Index, Luke" by Markus Winand: <https://use-the-index-luke.com/>
 - "B-trees and database indexes" by Benjamin Dicken: <https://planetscale.com/blog/btrees-and-database-indexes>

On consistency models: Jepsen's "Consistency Models": <https://jepsen.io/consistency>

Marz and Warren's _Big Data_ book was my introduction to big data, and its Lambda Architecture had a huge impact on me.
