Vik Paruchuri just released `Marker`, a tool for converting PDFs to Markdown.

Here's Vik's [Twitter/X thread](https://twitter.com/VikParuchuri/status/1730357379194400803) and the [codebase on GitHub](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker).

On a 2023 Apple M2 MacBook Pro I was able to install the needed dependencies and run it on some PDFs from [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/) without much difficulty.

From skimming a few pages of results, it looks pretty good; some of the markdown formatting choices are a bit unusual or don't respect the semantic structure of the page, but as a one-size-fits-all solution that also includes OCR it seems really useful.
