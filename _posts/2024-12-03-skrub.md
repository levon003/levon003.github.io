excerpt: Skrub is a cool and useful Python library.

[Skrub](https://github.com/skrub-data/skrub) is an amazing library being developed by Patricio Cerda, Gaël Varoquaux, and Balázs Kégl, among other contributors.

I used its functionality recently to save myself after a serious data screw-up. 
I wrote a script that produced a Qualtrics survey for a bunch of individual texts, but I lost the IDs that would enable me to match survey responses back to my original dataset.
With Skrub, I was able to execute a [fuzzy join](https://skrub-data.org/stable/auto_examples/04_fuzzy_joining.html), joining the datasets directly on the texts even though they were formatted differently (markdown vs HTML).

The miracle merge (in [this notebook](https://github.com/DigitalHarborFoundation/rag-for-math-qa/blob/main/notebooks/SurveyDataAnalysis.ipynb)):

```python
joined_df = skrub.fuzzy_join(
    df,
    survey_df,
    on="text",
    return_score=True,
    suffixes=("", "_survey"),
)
```

Notice the `return_score` parameter, which results in confidence scores based on the degree of text overlap.

143 were considered to be "perfect" matches, and I manually inspected the remaining 10 to verify they had been matched correctly.

The next time you find yourself with two messy but related datasets that could be joined on a text column if only they were normalized, try Skrub!
