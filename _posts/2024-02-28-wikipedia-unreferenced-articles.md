excerpt: A February 2024 "edit-a-thon" shows the variety in unreferenced Wikipedia articles.

Did you know that 100,000+ articles on Wikipedia cite no sources? In February 2024, [a community edit-a-thon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Unreferenced_articles/Backlog_drives/February_2024) aimed to reduce that number by finding and adding sources to articles.

Adding references to Wikipedia articles scratches my academic source-finding itch and is a great way to get started with Wikipedia editing.

Getting started with [making edits on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contributing_to_Wikipedia) can be a bit intimidating, but very rewarding!

If you take a look at a few unreferenced articles, you'll notice a few commonalities. 
For one, there are a ton of small villages, especially outside the US!
There are also a lot of metro stations, highways, organizations, and obscure albums.

Here's the list of articles I added sources to this month. About 1 article per day!
