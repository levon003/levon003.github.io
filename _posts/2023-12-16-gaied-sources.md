excerpt: Sources mentioned during the NeurIPS'23 Workshop on Generative AI for Education.
---

I attended the [NeurIPS'23 Workshop on Generative AI for Education (GAIED)](https://gaied.org/neurips2023/index.html) in New Orleans.
The organizers put together a nice [summary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01580) of the research presented at the workshop; a lot of the work focused on using in-context learning with OpenAI models. ([My paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03184) followed that trend.)

During the workshop, a number of interesting sources came up during presentations or in conversations.
This is my list of those sources (alphabetical):

During her talk and in the panel discussion, Elena Glassman highlighted two theories of learning that she thinks should be better known:
 - Variation Theory
 - Analogical Learning Theory

Here are a few links I dredged up from Google on those two theories (so not necessarily recommended):
 - Variation Theory
   - Craig Barton: <https://variationtheory.com/>
   - Neil Almond: <https://thirdspacelearning.com/us/blog/variation-theory/>
   - Eddie Cheng, "Learning through the Variation Theory: A Case Study": <https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1111116.pdf>
 - Analogical Learning Theory
   - Maureen Gray and Keith Holyoak, "Teaching by Analogy: From Theory to Practice": <https://reasoninglab.psych.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/273/2021/12/Gray_Holyoak.2021.pdf>
   - Dedre Gentner and Linsey Smith, "Analogical Learning and Reasoning": <https://groups.psych.northwestern.edu/gentner/papers/gentner&Smith_2013.3b.pdf>

Elena Glassman's talk also introduced me to the idea of alignable differences:
