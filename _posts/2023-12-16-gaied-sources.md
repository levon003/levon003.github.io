I attended the [NeurIPS'23 Workshop on Generative AI for Education (GAIED)](https://gaied.org/neurips2023/index.html) in New Orlean where I presented a paper:

>Zachary Levonian, Chenglu Li, Wangda Zhu, Anoushka Gade, Owen Henkel, Millie-Ellen Postle, and Wanli Xing. 2023. [Retrieval-augmented Generation to Improve Math Question-Answering: Trade-offs Between Groundedness and Human Preference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03184). In _NeurIPSâ€™23 Workshop on Generative AI for Education (GAIED)_, New Orleans, USA. DOI:<https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2310.03184>

During the workshop, a number of interesting sources came up during presentations or in conversations.
