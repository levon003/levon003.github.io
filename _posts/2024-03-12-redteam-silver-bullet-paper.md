["Red-Teaming for Generative AI: Silver Bullet or Security Theater?"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15897) is a January 2024 pre-print written by Michael Feffer, Anusha Sinha, Zachary Lipton, and Hoda Heidari. It caught my eye because of Zachary Lipton, who not only has a great first name but also wrote two of my favorite research papers (["The Mythos of Model Interpretability"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03490) and ["Detecting and Correcting for Label Shift with Black Box Predictors"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03916)).
