excerpt: Avoid ambiguous antecdenets, and a collection of academic writing tips from various people.

Jordan Boyd-Graber has a useful list of [tips for academic writing](https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/static/style.html). Other useful discussion in [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ashleylwatts/status/1740459900382376228).

Here's what I would add to that generally excellent advice:

The most common academic writing error is [ambiguous antecedents](https://www.dianewordsmith.com/the-write-stuff-blog/the-case-of-the-ambiguous-antecedent). The most common _form_ of ambiguous antecedent I see is sentences that begin "This is" (or "These are" - the _demonstrative pronouns_).

You should almost always rewrite these sentences to clarify the antecedent of "this". Any sentence that begins "This \<verb\>" is suspect.

Instead of:

>Wang et al. found X. This implies Y.

Be clear: (no pronoun)

>Wang et al. found X. X implies Y.

Or alternately: (noun phrase)

>Wang et al. found X. This finding implies Y.

Even where the reader can resolve the antecedent of "this" with a high degree of certainty, it still adds unneeded cognitive load for readers! And the ambiguity of "this" allows it to function as a weasel word that can hide lack of clarity or gaps in an argument.
