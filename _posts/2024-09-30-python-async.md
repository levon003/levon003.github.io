This post collects a few resources related to asynchronous programming in Python that I find useful.

 - Bob Nystrom's ["What Color is Your Function?"](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/)
 - Django's [Async adapter functions](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/async/#async-adapter-functions) documentation
 - The Python [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) documentation (see in particular ["Developing with asyncio"](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-dev.html))
 - Alyssa Coghlan's ["Some Thoughts on Asynchronous Programming"](https://python-notes.curiousefficiency.org/en/latest/pep_ideas/async_programming.html)
