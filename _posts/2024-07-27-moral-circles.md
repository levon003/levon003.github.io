In 2019, Waytz et al. published ["Ideological differences in the expanse of the moral circle"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12227-0) in _Nature Communciations_.

This paper uses the concept of [_moral circles_](https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2016/11/15/501972594/expanding-the-circle-of-moral-concern): "the circle of people or other entities in which you are concerned about right and wrong done toward them". For example, many people are concerned about right and wrong done toward their immediate family, but less concerned about right and wrong done toward rocks or trees.

The paper presents a variety of studies, but I was most interested by a particular survey study investigating how people allocate their moral concerns within moral circles.

In this study (study 3a), they asked 131 US residents to complete two tasks:

1. Zero-sum allocation of "moral units" across 16 increasingly large categories.
2. Indicating the _extent_ of their moral circle.

They were trying to test the hypothesis "that liberals relative to conservatives will show more moral concern toward nonhuman (relative to human) targets".

Here's what participants were told for the first task:

>In this section, we would like to think about your capacity to help, to give, to be charitable, to show empathy, and to be generous—in other words, your capacity to behave morally. We can think about people having different amounts of moral units—like currency—that they can spend on others and can allocate to different moral circles. Some people devote all of their moral units to one circle whereas others try to divide up their moral units amongst multiple circles. Again, by moral circle, we mean the circle of people or other entities in which you are concerned about right and wrong done toward them.

Here's what participants were told for the second task:

>On this page, we would like you to indicate the extent of your moral circle. By moral circle, we mean the circle of people or other entities for which you are concerned about right and wrong done toward them. This depiction demonstrates that people have different types of moral circles. At the innermost circle, some people care about their immediately family only, and at the outermost circle, people care about the entire universe - all things in existence. Please use the following scale and select a location that depicts the extent of your moral circle.
>
> 1. all of your immediate family
 2. all of your extended family
 3. all of your closest friends
 4. all of your friends (including distant ones)
 5. all of your acquaintances
 6. all people you have ever met
 7. all people in your country
 8. all people on your continent
 9. all people on all continents
 10. all mammals
 11. all amphibians, reptiles, mammals, fish, and birds
 12. all animals on earth including paramecia and amoebae
 13. all animals in the universe, including alien lifeforms
 14. all living things in the universe including plants and trees
 15. all natural things in the universe including inert entities such as rocks
 16. all things in existence
>
>Please click on a number that depicts the extent of your moral circle. Note that in this scale, the number you select includes the numbers below it as well. So, if you select 10 (all mammals), you are also including numbers 1-9 (up to 'all people on all continents') in your moral circle.

Who were the participants?

>One hundred thirty-one United States residents (53 male, Mean Age = 35.82, SD = 13.76) were recruited from the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) marketplace for a small monetary reward. .... Participants completed the study using Qualtrics software, including an ideology measure that contained seven options (very liberal, liberal, slightly liberal, moderate, slightly conservative, conservative, very conservative). .... Our sample included 64 liberals, 31 moderates, and 36 conservatives.

Here's the detailed ideology breakdown:

|   Political ideology | Participant count |
|---------------------:|--------:|
| Very liberal (1) |      11 |
| Liberal (2) |      35 |
| Slightly liberal (3) |      18 |
| Moderate (4) |      31 |
| Slightly conservative (5) |      10 |
| Conservative (6) |      16 |
| Very conservative (7) |      10 |
