Can recommendation systems help people find health-related peer support online?
Human-computer interaction researchers love to imply that they can.
I [wrote a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04973) exploring this question.

In the last few years I noticed a bunch of papers that: 
 - Study an online health community
 - Find some really interesting things
 - Identify design implications

Ridiculously often, one of their design implications is improving peer recommendation systems. I even [wrote a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.16172) like that too!

But, empirically, I couldn’t find any research **actually using recommendation systems to connect peers** (and thereby to increase their health-related social support).
Recommendation systems are ubiquitous on the big social media platforms, but the smaller, health-focused communities often have no recommendation system or very basic “recent activity” summaries.

I thought the lack of research on this topic was weird, and I wanted to know why people weren’t using or studying peer recommendation systems, so I [built one](https://github.com/levon003/HealthBlogRec).
With a team of student researchers, I deployed a peer recommendation system and convinced 79 people to use it for 12 weeks.
And as with any socio-technical system, it turns out there are a lot of barriers to implementing and evaluating this kind of thing.

Take a look in [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04973) and I bet you’ll find something that interests you.
We've got:
 - A quantitative survey asking people what they’re look for in potential peer connections
 - The real impacts of actually using a peer recommendation system
 - A qualitative investigation of how peers interacted with the complete strangers we recommended
