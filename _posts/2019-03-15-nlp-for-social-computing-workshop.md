On March 15th, 2019, I presented an "NLP for social computing researchers" workshop for my colleagues in the <a href="https://grouplens.org/">GroupLens</a> lab.

I presented some slides highlighting overlap between human-computer interaction and natural language processing, then I presented a Jupyter notebook demo on four topics:

 - Classification
 - Word embeddings
 - Language modeling
 - Topic modeling

All of the materials from the workshop are publicly available in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/levon003/nlp-for-hci-workshop).
See the slides on [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sMKPdqfQ1PY5WVC3SK-fWA3lw60ZEM5B0-4CvwhqJ_s/edit?usp=sharing) or as a [PDF]({{ "/files/NLP for HCI Workshop - March 15, 2019.pdf" | relative_url }}).
