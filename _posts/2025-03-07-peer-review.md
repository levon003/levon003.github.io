### How I think about peer review

Peer review is a responsibility for researchers. If you submit research work to be reviewed by others, I think you generally should be doing some reviewing. 

Non-students should generally review at the same workload they "generate" in submissions: a good rule of thumb is conducting three reviews for every first-author submission.

### How I write reviews

I write reviews using the following structure:

>===Paper summary and intended contribution===
>
>...
>
>===Reasons to accept===
>
>-...
>
>===Reasons to reject===
>
>-...
>
>===Originality of work and potential impact of results===
>
>...
>
>===Quality of execution===
>
>-Quality of execution seems {high,low,uneven,etc}.
>
>-...
>
>===Quality of presentation===
>
>-Quality of presentation seems {high,low,uneven,etc}.
>
>-...
>
>===Adequacy of citations===
>
>Citations are adequate to my knowledge, ...
>
>===Ethical concerns===
>
>...
>
>===Comments for authors===
>
>Thank you for your submission to {venue name}!  More detail-oriented comments below, in no particular order.
>
>-...
>
>
>===References===
>
>COI Disclosure: I am not a co-author or colleague of any of the authors of the papers I cite in this review.
>
>[1] ...
>
>[2] ...
>
>...

I include comments to the committee (that will not be visible to authors) at the end.

Why do I use this structure?
It was the structure used by the reviewing form for the first place I reviewed ([ICWSM 2019](https://www.icwsm.org/2019/)), and I find it to be useful for structuring my thoughts.

Recently, I have been including the following text at the bottom of my review:

>LLM Disclosure: I did not use generative AI technologies in the drafting of this review.

### Further reading

See Jeff Leek's ["Reviewing academic papers"](https://github.com/jtleek/reviews).

Many journals and conferences provide an explicit reviewing guide. (For example, [CHI 2024](https://chi2024.acm.org/submission-guides/guide-to-reviewing-papers/) has a nice reviewing guide.)
When in doubt, following the review guide is a good idea.

In [human-computer interaction]({% post_url 2025-02-26-intro-to-hci %}) specifically, I find Jacob Wobbrock and Julie Kientz's 2016 paper ["Research contributions in human-computer interaction"](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse510/16wi/readings/wobbrock_7contributions_submitted.pdf) to be a useful guide. About systems papers specifically, see Tessa Lau's 2010 blog post [Rethinking the Systems Review Process](https://cacm.acm.org/blogcacm/rethinking-the-systems-review-process/).

I've written other blog posts that touch on reviewing:
