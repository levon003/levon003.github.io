The buzz has been building on social media for a while, but I wanted to note my own personal tipping point: last week (January 12-16, 2026) I wrote the majority of my code using software development agents.
Specifically, I used a combination of [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) and [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/), both with Anthropic's [Claude Opus 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5) model.

I think these tools are officially a clear productivity boost for me. 
As echoed by many others, they not only make it easier to do the coding I was already planning to do, but they also make unthinkable refactors or fiddly, one-off tasks feasible – tasks that would otherwise not be worth the time. Just one example: I spent 30 minutes adding an [InquirerPy](https://inquirerpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [TUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) to a non-interactive [ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) tool, just to make managing pipeline metadata _slightly_ easier (and more accessible to non-developers on my team). I had never used InquirerPy before, so it was the perfect kind of task for large language models: labor-intensive for me to do, but easy to describe and easy to verify.

I wanted to mark this moment because overall I feel a strong sense of dread.
I worry about major disruptions to white collar work, I worry about losing my _own_ job, and I worry that even if I'm okay professionally my day-to-day work will become more competitive, less engaging, and more unstable.
While it's an exciting time, the uncertainty is very unpleasant.

Hopefully, I'll look back on this post in a few years and laugh at my fears. (LLMs will never capture [tacit knowledge](https://aeon.co/essays/big-data-ai-and-the-peculiar-dignity-of-tacit-knowledge), right?) Until then, I'll leave you with a few articles reflecting on the automation of intellectual work and the use of LLM coding agents.
