Here's an amusing [Hacker News comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40991325): 

>My company, which interviewed me by having me write ‘for’ loops in all 12 or so languages listed on my CV during the technical interview, is a pretty decent place to work.
>
>I cannot tell you how bemused I was after leaving that interview. I’d done months of degrading stupid ‘tell us some trivia about JS’ interviews, and here was someone that (apparently) just wanted to judge whether the information on my CV was true.

An amazing anecote, and I was somewhat chagrined to realize that I would almost surely fail this test.

Here are the programming languages I listed on the July 2024 version of my resume and my self-assesment of whether I could write a [`for` loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop) in that language.

The current version of my resume lists the following languages

| Language | Can I write a `for` loop in this language? |
| -- | --|
| Java | Yes, but probably not all possible variants without Googling |
| Python | Yes! |
| R | No way, but who writes for loops in R? |
| SQL | n/a |
| Bash | I would have to look this up, as I have to every time I write a non-trival bash script. |
| JavaScript | Yes, but I don't know what the modern approaches are. |
| Awk | Maybe? With error feedback, I think I could do this within 5 tries. |
| Clojure | I would have to look up the exact syntax, but I think I could get close. |
| Lua | It has been 10+ years; I think I could make a reasonable guess. |
| C | Yes, without confidence. |
| C# | Yes, without confidence about the differences from Java syntax. |
| Objective C | I would have to look this up, but I think my first guess would be close. |
| Scheme | Is the syntax different from Clojure? I would need to look this up. |

5 for 13 is pretty bad! But then again, I haven't used most of these languages in more than five years. Is this a reasonable measure of my skills as a developer? I'm a little skeptical, but it definitely says something about what level of recency and true mastery I think I need before I list a programming language on my resume.
