Came up while writing this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04973

on CLES and ROC AUC from (stats.stackexchange.com/a/71950): "the probability that a randomly sampled positive (or case) will have a higher marker value than a negative (or control)"

Specifically, CLES is the U-statistic divided by (n_group1 * n_group2)

Implications:
 - Report U statistics as the CLES; it's more interpretable!
