The [friendship paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship_paradox) is a surprising property of social networks:

>Most people have fewer friends than _their_ friends have.

This "paradox" – more accurately described as a structural property of social networks – was first described in a 1991 paper by Scott Feld called ["Why Your Friends Have More Friends Than You Do"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2781907).

Feld suggests this might lead to negative self-comparisons:

>It is reasonable to suppose that individuals use the number of friends that their friends have as one basis for determining whether they, themselves, have an adequate number of friends. This article shows that, if individuals compare themselves with their friends, it is likely that most of them will feel relatively inadequate.
